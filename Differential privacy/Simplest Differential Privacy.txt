Laplace mechanism, Exponential Mechanism and Gaussian Mechanism

Laplace Mechanism:
The Laplace mechanism adds noise from a Laplace distribution to the true query result.
It involves generating random noise, usually using a pseudorandom number generator.
The computational cost is primarily associated with generating the noise, which is relatively straightforward and efficient.


Exponential Mechanism:
The Exponential Mechanism is used for selecting elements from a dataset in a privacy-preserving manner based on their utility.
It involves computing the utility of each element with respect to the query being performed, and then selecting elements probabilistically according to their utility.
The computational cost can be higher compared to the Laplace mechanism, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex utility functions.


Gaussian Mechanism:
The Gaussian Mechanism adds noise from a Gaussian (normal) distribution to the true query result.
It involves generating noise from a Gaussian distribution, which typically requires more computational resources compared to generating Laplace noise.
Additionally, determining the appropriate scale parameter for the Gaussian distribution can be more involved compared to the Laplace mechanism.


Laplace mechanism is often considered to be the least computationally expensive among these mechanisms
