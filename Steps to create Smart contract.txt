1- Download Ganache and truffle

2- create truffle project 
truffle init
	- contracts directory
	- migration directory
	- test directory
	- truffle.config

 Configure Truffle to Connect to Ganache GUI
	module.exports = {
  networks: {
    development: {
      host: "127.0.0.1",
      port: 7545, // Default Ganache GUI port
      network_id: "*", // Match any network id
    },
  },




3- Create workspace ganache
get limit
and gas price 
and other configurations
give path to the truffle project config file
start the workspace

Ganacha cli and gui


4- Create smart contract and also migrations directory that contain the migration


4- Testing using different application like 
Mocha - the fun, simple, flexible JavaScript test framework

5- Compile the truffle project
truffle compile

if successfully you will see the contract in ganache smart contract tab


6- Deploy the contract
truffle migrate --network development

Genesis Block is created in ganache blockchain
everything is record in that blockchain log
you will get contract address



7- Interact with Your Smart Contract Using Web3
install web3

we need crypo wallet to connect with web3

that why we use metamask

8- Install and Connect Meta mask to dummy ganache blockchain
Testnet / Mainnet


Manually ADD
-Network name
-New RPC URL
-Chain ID
-Currency symbol
-Block explorer URL



Configure MetaMask:

Open MetaMask.
Enter the details:
Network Name: Ganache
New RPC URL: http://127.0.0.1:7545 (default Ganache RPC server)
Chain ID: 1337 (default Ganache Chain ID)
Symbol: ETH
Block Explorer URL: (leave empty)


9- Import Accounts from Ganache to MetaMask:
Copy the private key of an account.
In MetaMask, click on the account icon at the top right, then Import Account.
Paste the private key and click Import.

It will contain all the ETH's (FAKE ETH's for testing)


10- Create frontend
in js use code to connect web3 with metamask

npm install -g http-server
http-server
